The Fighting Fish Brewery website was a group project created for my Internet Tools and Web Design class.

The website includes the following five pages:
1. Home
1. About
1. Our Beers
1. Events
1. Shop

The entire project implements:
*HTML

*JavaScript
*Vue.js
*AJAX
*jQuery
*Bootstrap

I worked on the shop page using the following features of Vue.js:
*Component
*Two-way binding
*Conditional rendering
*Computed properties
*Style changes based on data
